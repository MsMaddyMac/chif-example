## Overview

This is an example of using C-Hear's file technology called **CHIF** (.chif) in a React App.

### What is a .chif?

CHIF stands for *C-Hear Intelligent File*. It was created by the company **C-Hear** to help make *websites and apps more digitally accessible for people with disabilities and visual impairments*.

- A .chif is made up of audio, text and metadata inside an image. 

- The small file size takes away the need to host videos on a video hosting site and allows the file to live right on your site/app. 

- There's no need to worry about slow loading due to the amount of images you may have on your site. An eCommerce site can use this easily and without loading issues.

### How to create a .chif?

Go to C-Hear's **CHIF Builder**, create it, download and save it in a directory on your computer.
